\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
% Describe why this comparative study is important
% Explain the relevance of supervised learning algorithms in real-world applications
% Introduce the problem you're trying to solve

\subsection{Objectives}

The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of foundational supervised learning algorithms by implementing, analyzing, and comparing multiple models on a real-world dataset. Specifically, we aim to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement and train various classification algorithms
    \item Evaluate model performance using multiple metrics
    \item Compare and contrast different approaches
    \item Analyze the trade-offs between model complexity and performance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Report Structure}
During this assignment, the SEMMA methodology will be followed:

\begin{quote}
According to (Moine et al., 2011), the SEMMA methodology has five basic phases: Sample, Explore, Modify, Model and Assess. From (Olson and Delen, 2008) SEMMA facilitates the statistical exploration, the visualization techniques and the selection and transforming of the relevant variables in prediction, also can model the variables for prediction processes and later validate the precision of the model.
