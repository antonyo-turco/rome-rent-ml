\subsection{Motivation}
% Describe why this comparative study is important
% Explain the relevance of supervised learning algorithms in real-world applications
% Introduce the problem you're trying to solve

\subsection{Objectives}
The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of foundational supervised learning algorithms by implementing, analyzing, and comparing multiple models on a real-world dataset. Specifically, we aim to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement and train various classification algorithms
    \item Evaluate model performance using multiple metrics
    \item Compare and contrast different approaches
    \item Analyze the trade-offs between model complexity and performance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Report Structure}
This report is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Section \ref{sec:dataset}: Description of the dataset and preprocessing steps
    \item Section \ref{sec:methodology}: Methodology and model descriptions
    \item Section \ref{sec:results}: Experimental results and evaluation
    \item Section \ref{sec:analysis}: Comparative analysis and discussion
    \item Section \ref{sec:conclusions}: Conclusions and future work
\end{itemize}
